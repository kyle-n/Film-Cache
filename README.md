# Film Cache

A clean, simple, modern macOS application for showing movie showtimes around Logan, Utah.

## Building locally

1. Clone the source code
2. Open in Xcode
3. Add a new file, `Film Cache/env.swift`
4. Add your TMDB API read-access token.

```swift
let TMDB_API_READ_TOKEN = "your.token.here"
```

5. Build and run.

## What is this? Why is this?

Just felt like building something for fun. Why not make the most uncommercial possible app?
